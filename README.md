OpART in my opinion is an art that gives you an illusional form i just feel like there is some stuff moving around the art it's self and i really like it......artists used only black and white in order to produce the greatest contrast in their designs, since this contrast causes the greatest confusion for the eye, which struggles to discern which element of the composition is in the foreground and which in the background. But color was also a focus of attention at times, as in Vasarely's Plastic Alphabet series 1960 to 1980 The ways in which color suggests space and the ways colors contrast with one another, proved fertile areas for experiment i got these information from this website and i picked this website because it shows a lot of trusted information and i really liked the website details https://www.theartstory.org/movement-op-art.htm
Michelangelo is fromCaprese Michelangelo, Italyd and  Paul Cezanne's is fromAix-en-Provence, Franceand  Leonardo da Vinci's from Anchiano, Italyare one of my best artists.. their work is perfectly perfect becauese you can't just do an art and i think they worked hard on it because you need to focus alot specially when you're creating an art..
